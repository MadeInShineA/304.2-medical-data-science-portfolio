This decision was motivated by the fact that’s it’s an industry standard.\nWe also setup the according teams, with specific filters to help people quickly what task they need to do (as seen on Figure 1 )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Jira filters overview\n\n\n\n\n\nKick off meeting\nOn Tuesday morning, we had a meeting with the CEO and CTO of our company (5MM).\nDuring this meeting, we were asked to introduce ourselves, and come to agreement regarding the different positions within the group.\nAs this week scrum master, I was successfully able to keep the meeting easy going and focused on the things that needed to be done.\n\n\nSprint 1 planning\nThe planning of the first sprint was elaborated on Tuesday afternoon\nYou can see on Figure 2 bellow what we came up with\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Jira dashboard overview"
