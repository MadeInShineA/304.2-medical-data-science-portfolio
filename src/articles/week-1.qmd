> **Role this week**: Scrum master + Data engineer

## What was done ?

### Team organization

As a scrum master, I took care of leading the discussion regarding the organization of my 9 developers team.

We came to this structure:

```

It should be noted that the **bold** names represent team leaders, who will have an extra weekly meeting (based on my suggestion).

We also had to agree to a rotation of the scrum master, product owner and client relationship roles

Here is what we agreed on:


|                         | Week 1  | Week 2   | Week 3 | Week 4 | Week 5 | Week 6        | Week 7 |
|-------------------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Scrum master**        | Olivier | Ana     | Simon   | Yolan  | Loic   | Unal          | Vincent|
| **Product owner**       | Ana     | Olivier | Yolan   | Simon  | Unal   | Filip         | Robin  |
| **Client relationship** | Vincent | -       | Filip   | -      |  -     | Robin & Loic  | -      |

### Development environment setup

I setup a basic development environment including a project repository (see [github](https://github.com/madeinshinea/304.2-medical-data-science){target="_blank"})

This includes:

 - a basic [README file](https://github.com/MadeInShineA/304.2-medical-data-science/blob/main/README.md){target="_blank"}, 
 - a small [project website](https://olivier.amacker.dev/304.2-medical-data-science/){target="_blank"}  made with [quarto](https://quarto.org/){target="_blank"}
deployed to a [github page](https://docs.github.com/en/pages){target="_blank"}
through a [github action](https://github.com/features/actions) (see [action](https://github.com/MadeInShineA/304.2-medical-data-science/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy_website.yml){target="_blank"})

I also convinced my classmates to use github policies as follow:

 - Each feature must be developed on a separate branch
 - A pull request needs to be made to evaluate a feature
 - The feature pull requests need to be verified by at least 2 other individuals, including 1 from another team

### Collaborative environment setup

I convinced my fellow colleagues to use [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira){target="_blank"}. This decision was motivated
by the fact that's it's an industry standard.

We also setup the according teams, with specific filters to help people quickly what task they need to do 
<br>(as seen on @fig-jira-filters )

### Kick off meeting

On Tuesday morning, we had a meeting with the CEO and CTO of our company (5MM).

During this meeting, we were asked to introduce ourselves, and come to agreement regarding the different positions within the group.

As this week scrum master, I was successfully able to keep the meeting easy going and focused on the things that needed to be done.


### Sprint 1 planning

The planning of the first sprint was elaborated on Tuesday afternoon

You can see on @fig-test bellow what we came up with
