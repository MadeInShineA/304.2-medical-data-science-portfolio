## General Guidelines
- **Language:** All documentation, commit messages, PR descriptions, comments, and issues must be written in English.
- **Task Management:** All tasks must be tracked via [github issues](https://github.com/features/issues){target="_blank"}. No work should begin without an associated issue.
- **CI/CD:** Continuous Integration and Deployment pipelines are mandatory.
  - Automatic tests must run on every Pull Request.
  - The application must build successfully upon release.

## Branching Strategy
We follow a git flow inspired strategy with two long-lived branches: `main` and `dev`.


- **`main`**: Production-ready code. Stable releases only.
- **`dev`**: Integration branch. Features are merged here for testing before production.
- **Feature Branches:** Each feature or fix must be developed on a separate branch created from `dev`.
  - **Naming Convention:** `<type>/<description>`
  - **Examples:**
    - `feat/user-login-pages`
    - `fix/cdc-connection`

The possible tags can be found here:

| Type | Usage |
| :--- | :--- |
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `refactor` | Code refactor without functional change |
| `docs` | Documentation changes |
| `test` | Adding or modifying tests |
| `chore` | Config, dependencies, CI changes |
| `style` | Formatting only (no code logic change) |
| `perf` | Performance improvements |

#### Commit Standards
- **Format:** `<type>: <Description>`
- **Style:** Imperative mood (e.g., "Add" instead of "Added").
- **Examples:**
  - `fix: Auto refresh issue`
  - `test: Add login test`
  - `docs: Update bluetooth technical guide`
- **Merge Strategy:** All merges into `dev` and `main` must use **Squash & Merge** to keep history clean.

## Pull Request (PR) Workflow
A Pull Request is required to evaluate any feature. Merging rules differ based on the target branch.

### PR to `dev`
- **Description:** Must summarize added features and precisely describe what was done.
- **Requirements:**
  - Must include relevant tests.
  - Must include technical documentation (GitHub Wiki{target="_blank"}).
  - Must include user documentation (Quarto/Website).
  - Must be linked to one or more Issues.
- **Approval:** Requires verification by **at least 2 individuals**:
  - 1 member from the current team.
  - 1 member from **another team** (external review).

### PR to `main` (Release)
- **Description:** Must contain a summary of features (with links to the Wiki if possible).
- **Approval:** Must be explicitly accepted by the **Scrum Master** and the **Product Owner**.

## Issue Management
- **Templates:** Issues must follow a precise template to ensure consistency.
- **Metadata:** Issues must contain relevant tags/labels.
- **Quality:** Issues must be clear, consistent, and actionable before development starts.

## Versioning & Releases
- **Versioning:** Clear versioning must be maintained for the client (e.g., Semantic Versioning).
- **Patchnotes:** A detailed patchnote documenting all additions and changes must be created for every new version.
- **Tagging:** Releases on `main` must be tagged (e.g., `v1.0.0`).

## Visual Workflow
The following graph illustrates the standard development lifecycle, from feature creation to release:

gitGraph
    commit id: "Init"
    branch dev
    checkout dev
    
    branch feat/user-login-pages
    checkout feat/user-login-pages
    commit id: "feat: Login UI"
    commit id: "test: Add login test"
    commit id: "fix: Auto refresh issue"

    checkout dev
    merge feat/user-login-pages id: "Squash Merge 1" type: HIGHLIGHT
    
    branch fix/cdc-connection
    checkout fix/cdc-connection
    commit id: "fix: CDC connection bug"
    
    checkout dev
    merge fix/cdc-connection id: "Squash Merge 2" type: HIGHLIGHT
    
    checkout main
    merge dev id: "Release v1.0.0" tag: "v1.0.0" type: HIGHLIGHT
```
